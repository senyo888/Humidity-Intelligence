# Release Governance

Humidity Intelligence uses semantic versioning with explicit prerelease markers for
testing and validation branches.

## Canonical Version Model

- `2.0.6-beta.1`, `2.0.6-beta.2`: testing builds.
- `2.0.6-rc.1`: release-candidate builds.
- `2.0.6`: stable version label.

The integration version in `manifest.json` is the release-state source of truth for
Home Assistant and HACS metadata checks.

v2.0.6 is the current stable release milestone. The rules below remain the active
promotion model for future versions and for any v2.0.6 maintenance patch.

## Branch Responsibilities

- `senyo888-patch-1`: staging lane for all manifest labels. It may carry beta, rc,
  or stable version metadata while work is being prepared and reviewed.
- `develop`: release-candidate or stable version metadata only. Beta labels stay on
  `senyo888-patch-1`.
- `main`: stable production version metadata only. No prerelease suffix is allowed.
- `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`: release-verification branch for the exact matching stable
  manifest version only. For example, `v2.0.6` may carry `2.0.6`, but not
  `2.0.6-rc.1` or `2.0.7`.
- Short-lived development branches, including `Bella/*`, `codex/*`, `feature/*`,
  `fix/*`, `patch/*`, and `test/*`, must not carry stable manifest versions.

## Promotion Rules

1. Beta, rc, and stable labels may be staged on `senyo888-patch-1`.
2. Promotion to `develop` uses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N` or stable
   `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version metadata only.
3. Promotion to `main` uses stable `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version metadata only.
4. Exact `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` branches may be used for stable release-verification CI,
   but they do not replace the `main` release/tag gate.
5. A GitHub release is created only from a stable version on `main`.

## Hard Release Gates

No Humidity Intelligence version release, GitHub release, or release tag may be created
until all of these gates are satisfied:

- Bella verification has confirmed source-of-truth alignment, UI truth consistency,
  deterministic release boundaries, and README/release-note coherence.
- AetherCore verification has confirmed governance coherence, role-boundary integrity,
  proposal/release-process consistency, and local/public boundary safety. This is a
  governance verification gate; it does not make AetherCore a runtime authority or
  release approver.
- Release sanity validation has passed for the change scope, including version
  governance, HACS/package metadata checks, and the relevant Home Assistant runtime,
  direct sanity, service, or generated-card checks.
- The `humidity-intelligence-maintenance` companion has been updated with advisory
  release-gate evidence, blocker notes, or an explicit no-op maintenance status for
  the staging promotion. This records maintenance evidence only; it does not approve
  promotion or change canonical HI truth.
- Wiki update status is recorded as `updated`, `no-op`, or `blocked` for any release
  that changes support flow, diagnostics, generated dashboards, HACS/update guidance,
  configuration behavior, services, entity semantics, or release documentation. The
  Wiki remains a public support manual; runtime and release truth stay in the
  repository source and release documentation.
- The README has maintainer approval before release tagging.

If any gate is missing for the version being prepared, the release state is `not ready`,
even when the manifest version already carries a stable number on `senyo888-patch-1`,
`develop`, or `main`.

## Enforcement

`scripts/check_version_governance.py` validates the branch/version contract locally and
in CI. It rejects:

- prerelease versions on `main`
- beta versions on `develop`
- stable versions on short-lived testing branches
- prerelease or mismatched stable versions on `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` branches
- stable versions on unapproved branches outside `senyo888-patch-1`, `develop`, and
  `main`, plus exact matching `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` release-verification branches

This is a release-boundary guard only. It does not alter runtime logic, entity
semantics, generated dashboards, or Home Assistant services.

## HACS Integration Preflight

HACS Integration Preflight is an optional but recommended local/VS Code release-perimeter
check before promotion. Run it from the release-source checkout or a worktree after
implementation sanity and before the final release readiness review.

Use it for:

- HACS/install metadata validation
- release packaging sanity
- `manifest.json`, `hacs.json`, branding, workflow, and repository hygiene support

Do not treat it as a replacement for pytest, direct runtime/card sanity, Home Assistant
runtime validation, Bella coherence review, Aetherwing validation, or version governance.
Preflight findings are packaging/readiness findings only; they must not imply runtime
behavior, service, diagnostics, UI generation, or configuration-flow changes unless a
separate implementation patch is explicitly approved.
